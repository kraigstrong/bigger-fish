# Bigger Fish

There's always a bigger fish.

V0 prototype: a one-touch iPhone game (landscape, SwiftUI + SpriteKit, iOS 17+).
Hold to rise. Release to fall. Eat fish smaller than you. Avoid fish larger than you. Become the last fish swimming.

## Running

Open `BiggerFish.xcodeproj` in Xcode, pick your iPhone or a simulator, and Run.
Signing uses automatic signing with team `MKACSCQ588`.

Unit tests (wrapping, size rules, growth, win detection):

```bash
xcodebuild test -project BiggerFish.xcodeproj -scheme BiggerFish -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
```

## Tuning

Every feel constant — movement, growth, swallow timing, AI behavior, spawn distribution,
and the `aiFishCanEatEachOther` flag — lives in `BiggerFish/GameTuning.swift`.
